In this project, I created a SuperBowl Prediction app for the 2022 NFL Season. Predictions include AFC and NFC teams, final score, and Superbowl MVP. </br>
Teams and respective logos, and superbowl MVP are selected randomly from arrays using simple if-else statements and switch cases in Javascript. </br>
Enjoy!
